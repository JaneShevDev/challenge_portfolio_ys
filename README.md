Task 1: software configuration.

Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?

I have always been interested in the IT field, but I did not dare to try. It seemed to me that programmers are superhumans who create amazing things out of nothing! After the war began in Ukraine, I decided not to put aside my desires anymore. Therefore, after my arrival in Poland, I am actively looking for opportunities to develop in IT direction and I already have little experience in learning programming languages.

I will not hide the fact that for me, a person who has never dealt with the IT field, it was and is now very difficult to capture, understand, remember, apply the necessary amount of information. I also understand that in order to feel confident, I need to study for a very long time. But with every success on the path of learning, I am inspired more and more and begin to believe that I can do a lot. It's an indescribable feeling when you can write code, and it works! It charges me! I realized that I would not be bored and I like IT.

And in the future I hope to become a professional!
Which of course will change my and my family life for the better.
